# Video

Shows an embedded video player component. The video player does not have any controls. Instead, the video player provides the events and commands necessary to build the controls for controlling the video.

## Sample description

This sample demonstrates the video playback, as well as listening to events.  

## Tips/Notes  

Not all devices support video playback.  Even some devices that support APL might not support playback. Use the environment property disallowVideo to check if device supports video. For server-side checking, use context.Viewport.video property in the request.
